# Kinematics

Kinematics is the study of motion without considering its causes. It is the foundation for understanding all of mechanics.

## Concepts to Learn First
- Scalars and vectors
- Displacement, velocity, and acceleration
- Reference frames
- Graphical analysis of motion
- Derivatives and integrals in motion

## Most Important Concepts

### 1. Linear Motion
- Position: $x(t)$
- Velocity: $v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt}$
- Acceleration: $a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt}$
- Equations of motion for constant acceleration:
  - $x = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2$
  - $v = v_0 + a t$
  - $v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(x - x_0)$

### 2. Projectile Motion
- 2D motion under gravity
- Independence of horizontal and vertical motion
- Range, maximum height, and time of flight

### 3. Circular Motion
- Angular displacement, velocity, and acceleration
- Centripetal acceleration: $a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$
- Period and frequency

### 4. Relative Motion
- Relative velocity: $\vec{v}_{A/B} = \vec{v}_A - \vec{v}_B$
