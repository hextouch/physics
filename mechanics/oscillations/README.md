# Oscillations

Oscillations are repetitive variations, typically in time, of some measure about a central value.

## Concepts to Learn First
- Simple harmonic motion (SHM)
- Amplitude, period, frequency
- Damped and driven oscillations

## Most Important Concepts

### 1. Simple Harmonic Motion
- Displacement: $x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)$
- Angular frequency: $\omega = 2\pi f$
- Period: $T = \frac{1}{f}$
- Energy in SHM: $E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2$

### 2. Damped Oscillations
- Damping force: $F = -bv$
- Underdamped, critically damped, overdamped cases

### 3. Driven Oscillations and Resonance
- Driving force: $F = F_0 \cos(\omega_{\text{drive}} t)$
- Resonance phenomenon

**Mathematical Tools:**
- Differential equations
- Trigonometric identities
