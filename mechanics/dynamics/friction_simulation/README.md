# Friction and Drag

Friction and drag are forces that oppose motion. Understanding them is essential for solving real-world dynamics problems.

## Concepts to Learn First
- Types of friction: static vs. kinetic
- Coefficient of friction ($\mu$)
- Normal force ($N$)
- Drag forces (air resistance)

## Most Important Concepts
- Kinetic friction: $f_k = \mu_k N$
- Static friction: $f_s \leq \mu_s N$
- Drag force: $F_{\text{drag}} = -bv$ (linear), $F_{\text{drag}} = -cv^2$ (quadratic)
- Terminal velocity

**Mathematical Tools:**
- Free-body diagrams
- Newton's laws
- Algebraic manipulation

**Recommended order:**
1. Static and kinetic friction
2. Drag forces
3. Terminal velocity
