# Dynamics

Dynamics is the study of the forces and torques that cause motion. It builds on kinematics by explaining why objects move.

## Concepts to Learn First
- Newton's Laws of Motion
- Free-body diagrams
- Types of forces (gravity, normal, friction, tension, etc.)
- Mass and inertia
- Net force and equilibrium

## Most Important Concepts

### 1. Newton's Laws
- **First Law (Inertia):** An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by a net force.
- **Second Law:** $\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = m \vec{a}$
- **Third Law:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

### 2. Friction and Drag
- Static and kinetic friction: $f_k = \mu_k N$
- Air resistance and drag forces

### 3. Applications of Newton's Laws
- Atwood's machine
- Inclined planes
- Pulleys and connected objects

### 4. Derivatives in Dynamics
- Acceleration as the derivative of velocity
- Velocity as the derivative of position
- Using calculus to relate motion and force
