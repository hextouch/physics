# Atwood's Machine

Atwood's machine is a classic system for applying Newton's laws to connected objects.

## Concepts to Learn First
- Tension in a string
- Newton's second law for multiple objects
- Free-body diagrams

## Most Important Concepts
- Acceleration of the system: $a = \frac{g(m_1 - m_2)}{m_1 + m_2}$
- Tension in the string: $T = \frac{2m_1 m_2 g}{m_1 + m_2}$
- Massless, frictionless pulley assumptions

**Mathematical Tools:**
- System of equations
- Newton's laws

**Recommended order:**
1. Free-body diagrams
2. Acceleration and tension calculation
3. Extensions (friction, pulley mass)
