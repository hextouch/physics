# Inclined Plane

The inclined plane is a fundamental problem in dynamics, illustrating the effects of gravity, normal force, and friction.

## Concepts to Learn First
- Decomposition of forces
- Normal and friction forces
- Newton's second law along the incline

## Most Important Concepts
- Component of gravity along the incline: $mg\sin\theta$
- Normal force: $N = mg\cos\theta$
- Friction force: $f = \mu N$
- Acceleration down the plane: $a = g(\sin\theta - \mu\cos\theta)$

**Mathematical Tools:**
- Trigonometry
- Newton's laws

**Recommended order:**
1. Force decomposition
2. Acceleration and friction
3. Applications (with/without friction)
