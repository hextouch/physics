# Mechanics

Classical mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the motion of objects and the forces acting upon them.

## Key Topics

## Mathematical Concepts Required (for all Mechanics subtopics)

To master all subtopics in mechanics, you should be comfortable with the following math concepts:

- **Scalars and vectors** (vector algebra, vector decomposition)
- **Diff and integration** (for motion analysis, work, energy, rotational motion, oscillations)
- **Reference frames**
- **Graphical analysis of motion**
- **Algebraic manipulation**
- **Trigonometric identities** (especially for circular motion and oscillations)
- **Radians and degrees** (for rotational motion)
- **Vector cross product** (for torque and angular momentum)
- **System of equations** (for multi-body problems)
- **Differential equations** (for oscillations)

These concepts are foundational for:
- Kinematics: motion, derivatives, integrals, vectors
- Dynamics: forces, free-body diagrams, equilibrium, Newton's laws
- Energy & Momentum: work, energy, momentum, collisions
- Rotational Motion: angular kinematics, moment of inertia, torque
- Oscillations: SHM, damping, resonance, energy in oscillations
