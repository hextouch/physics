- Projectile motion
- Circular motion

### Dynamics
- Newton's laws of motion
- Force and mass
- Friction and drag forces
- Applications of Newton's laws

### Energy and Momentum
- Work and kinetic energy
- Potential energy
- Conservation of energy
- Linear and angular momentum
- Conservation of momentum
- Collisions

### Rotational Motion
- Angular kinematics
- Moment of inertia
- Torque and angular momentum
- Rolling motion

### Oscillations
- Simple harmonic motion
- Pendulums
- Damped and driven oscillations
- Resonance

## Fundamental Equations

- Newton's second law: **F = ma**
- Kinematic equations: **v = v₀ + at**, **s = ut + ½at²**
- Work-energy theorem: **W = ΔKE**
- Conservation of momentum: **Σp₁ = Σp₂**

## Applications
