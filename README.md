# Classical Physics

A comprehensive collection of classical physics topics, implementations, and educational resources.

To refresh all physics topics in your project, here‚Äôs a suggested learning path based on the structure and content of the README files in each directory:

1. Mechanics (Start Here)
Begin with kinematics and dynamics: motion, Newton‚Äôs laws, energy, and momentum.
Progress to rotational motion and oscillations.
This forms the foundation for all other physics topics.
2. Waves
Study wave fundamentals, types, and phenomena (reflection, interference, resonance).
Covers both mechanical and electromagnetic waves, linking to later topics.
3. Thermodynamics
Learn the laws of thermodynamics, heat engines, entropy, and statistical mechanics.
Essential for understanding energy transfer and physical systems.
4. Fluid Dynamics
Explore properties of fluids, flow types, and key equations (Bernoulli, Navier-Stokes).
Applications in nature, engineering, and biological systems.
5. Electromagnetism
Cover electrostatics, magnetostatics, electromagnetic induction, and Maxwell‚Äôs equations.
Study electromagnetic waves, which connect to optics and modern physics.
6. Optics
Focus on geometric and wave optics, including reflection, refraction, interference, and diffraction.
Learn about optical instruments and applications.
Recommended Path:
