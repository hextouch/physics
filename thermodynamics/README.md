# Thermodynamics

Thermodynamics deals with heat, temperature, energy, and the relationships between them.

## Key Topics

### Laws of Thermodynamics
- Zeroth law (thermal equilibrium)
- First law (conservation of energy)
- Second law (entropy)
- Third law (absolute zero)

### Thermal Properties
- Temperature and heat
- Specific heat capacity
- Thermal expansion
- Phase changes

### Heat Engines and Cycles
- Carnot cycle
- Otto cycle (internal combustion)
- Diesel cycle
- Refrigeration cycles

### Statistical Mechanics
- Kinetic theory of gases
- Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
- Entropy and microstates
- Partition functions

## Fundamental Equations

- First law: **dU = Q - W**
- Entropy change: **dS ≥ dQ/T**
- Ideal gas law: **PV = nRT**
- Carnot efficiency: **η = 1 - T_c/T_h**

## Applications

- Power generation
- Refrigeration and air conditioning
- Materials science
- Chemical processes
- Climate science
